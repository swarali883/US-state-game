# US-state-game

This is an educational and interesting game which gets you to guess and learn all the States in the US. 
It has a map of Unites States and it’s all blank until you start guessing some States and then you keep 
going until you’ve managed to get all 50. When I go and add another state name and hit ‘OK’, then that 
name appears on the map at the location of the state. The aim of the game is to remember all of the names 
of the states and to name as many as you can. We have some sort of way of typing an ‘exit’. When I type ‘exit’, 
then I could exit out of the game and then I could get my code to generate a CSV file that contains all of 
the states that I missed from all 50 states.
